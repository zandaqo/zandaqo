### Greetings!

I'm Maga, a Web Platform Engineer and Entrepreneur. My latest product is
[Cisterna.app](https://cisterna.app)--a SaaS Warehouse Management System (WMS)
for bulk fluid storage facilities built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).
I'm currently working on an educational startup (in closed alpha).

I share code on GitHub and infrequently write on
[medium](https://medium.com/@zandaqo).

When I am not busy with the above, I (re-)listen to the Discworld novels of Sir
Terry Pratchett, occasionally managing to squeeze in
[a book or two](https://goodreads.com/zandaqo) of other authors.

Three times a week, I pretend to be a human forklift in the local gym,
sporadically competing in powerlifting meets (PR 480@74 PL RAW).

You can reach me via [denelxan@gmail.com](mailto:denelxan@gmail.com). Feel free
to use English, Spanish, Russian, Nakh, or Ook.
